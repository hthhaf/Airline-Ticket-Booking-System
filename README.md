Flight booking system with B2C model.

There are three user levels within the ticket booking system: User, Agent, and Administrator.
 + Users have basic permissions in the ticket booking system, they can search for the desired destination, choose a seat, and make a payment in one click.
 + Agents are users who can manage the functionality and have access to all features within the system.
 + Administrator is able to manage every aspect of the system, has visibility to all features and changes system settings.
